## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

Created a visualization dashboard website utilizing plots from [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

Individual pages for each plot were created and a means to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The website also includes a landing page, a page with a comparison of all of the plots, and another page with the data used to build them.

The website also includes a navigation menu at the top of every page, and it's deployed to GitHub pages.
